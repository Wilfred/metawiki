This website is a **metawiki**.

Unlike normal wikis, you can edit both the content and
the website functionality.

This website is written in JavaScript, and the source
is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/Wilfred/metawiki).

## What can I edit?
You can edit the content on this site. For example, you can 
[edit this page](#edit?page/Home), or [create a new page](#new).

You can also edit the JS ([models](#edit?metawiki/models.js),
[routing](#edit?metawiki/routing.js), 
[controllers](#edit?metawiki/controllers.js),
[AllPagesController](#edit?metawiki/AllPagesController.js),
[templates](#edit?metawiki/templates.js), 
[messages](#edit?metawiki/messages.js), 
[editor](#edit?metawiki/editor.js), 
[app](#edit?metawiki/app.js)),
[the CSS](#edit?metawiki/metawiki.css)
or [the HTML](#edit?metawiki/index.html) of the site itself!

The database is reset once an hour, so feel free to experiment.

## Why should I care?
Metawikis are really interesting because they test the limits of the
web as an application platform.

They present [many programming challenges](#page/Challenges) because
traditional software engineering doesn't work here. Metawikis
are also [difficult to secure](#page/Security).

## Tell me more!

[known bugs](#page/Bugs).
