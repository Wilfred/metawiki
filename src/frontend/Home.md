# Metawiki

## What is a metawiki?
A metawiki is a website where both the content and
the functionality can be edited within the site itself.

This is a demo version of [wikicircle](https://github.com/Wilfred/wikicircle),
a metawiki implementation.

## What can I edit?
You can edit the content on this site. For example, you can 
[edit this page](#edit?md/Home), or [create a new page](#new).

You can also  [edit the app JS](#edit?js/wikicircle/app.js),
[the models JS](#edit?js/wikicircle/models.js),
[the CSS](#edit?js/wikicircle/wikicircle.css)
or [the HTML](#edit?html/index.html) of the site itself!

The database is reset once an hour, so feel free to experiment.

## Why should I care?
Metawikis are really interesting. They're challenging to write. Traditional
front end practices don't work. They're hard to secure.

## TODO
* Handle trying to edit a nonexistent page.
* Changing mode isn't changing highlighting
* 'Save and continue editing' doesn't work for new pages
