## Full Metawikis
The idea of a metawiki is not new. C2 has pages on
[metawikis](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?MetaWiki),
[programmable wikis](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WikiWithProgrammableContent)
and [partly programmable wikis](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?SmartWiki).

However, most of metawikis mentioned are long dead.

The only full metawiki I'm aware of today is
[alphawiki](http://epsilonwiki.free.fr/alphawiki_2/).
Since it contains a custom programming language and syntax
it's hard to directly compare to this implementation.

## Partial Metawikis
Mediawiki supports
[a lua sandbox for scripting templates](http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Lua_scripting).
These templates are used for common layouts within pages, rather than
basic wiki functionalitiy.

## Self-Hosting Editors
The idea of a self-hosting editing environment is well established in the lisp
(lisp machines, Emacs) and smalltalk (Squeak, Smalltalk) languages.

There's very little self-hosting tooling on the web.

[Amber Smalltalk](http://amber-lang.net/) is a smalltalk implementation that
is compiled to JS. Amber provides a full set of development tools (editor, REPL,
unit tests, debugger) that run inside the browser.

The [Lively Kernel](http://lively-kernel.org/) is a set of JS libraries that
allow you to develop web applications with an IDE in the browser. It is developed
by Dan Ingalls, a notable Smalltalk developer.

[Untrusted](http://alexnisnevich.github.io/untrusted/) is a JS game that
also explores ideas of editing a site as you use it.
